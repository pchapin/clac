aClac
=====

This folder contains the Android implementation of Clac.

*NOTE* This version of Clac is immature and not maintained. It was never more than a skeleton.
It was only just recently upgraded to use the latest Android Studio and a modern version of
Android. At the moment, it is broken and won't compile.
